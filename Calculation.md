HOUR HAND--->
12hrs take 360deg rotation of the hour hand
1hr takes 360/12deg of rotation i.e 30deg
SO, h hours would take '30h' deg of rotaion of hour hand
ALSO,
60min takes 30deg of rotation of the hour hand
so 1min = 30deg/60min = 0.5deg
so, 'm' min would take '0.5m' deg of rotation of hour hand

THEREFORE,
TOTAL HOUR HAND ROTATION = '30h + 0.5m' [where h=hours m=mins]

MINUTE HAND--->
60min takes 360deg of rotation of the minute hand
so 1min = 360/60deg of rotation = 6deg
so, m minutes = 6m deg of rotation of minute hand

ALSO,
60sec=1min=6deg
so 1sec = 6/60 = 0.1deg
so, s seconds = 0.1s deg of minute hand

THEREFORE,
TOTAL MINUTE HAND ROTATION = '6m + 0.1s' [where s=seconds,m=mins]

SECOND HAND--->
60sec takes 360deg of rotation of the second hand
so 1sec = 360/60 = 6deg
so, s seconds = 6s deg of rotation of second hand

THEREFORE,
TOTAL SECOND HAND ROTATION = '6s' [where s=seconds]
